<h1>PureChem - www.purechem.vercel.app</h1>
<h3>Hi! I'm Chetan Gorantla, one of the three devs (me, Cosmo Wu, and Sidharth Duttala) that made this website.<h3>
<p>PureChem is a website to help students prepare for AP Chemistry and USNCO. </p>
<p>Features of this website include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Reaction calculator that can balance equations, calculate dG, dH, dS, <br/>and provide an ICE and BCA table</li>
    <br></br>
    <li>Titration calculator that calculates the pH at different parts of a titration and finds the unknown molarity</li>
    <br></br>
    <li>Solubility and Melting point predictors that reorder given compounds in order of <br/>solubility or melting point</li>
    <br></br>
    <li>100+ practice problems for all chemistry topics</li>
</ul>
<p>Our goal is to make chemistry calculators more accessible for everyone. We hope you find our website useful!</p>
