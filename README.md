## About PureChem

Hi! I'm Chetan Gorantla, one of the three developers of PureChem, alongside Cosmo Wu and Sidharth Duttala. We're high school seniors passionate about Computer Science, and we built this website to help fellow students.

**PureChem** is designed to assist students in preparing for AP Chemistry and the US National Chemistry Olympiad (USNCO). Our goal is to make chemistry calculators more accessible and approachable for everyone, so we hope you find our website useful!

## Features

- **Reaction Calculator**: Balance chemical equations, calculate ΔG, ΔH, ΔS, and generate ICE and BCA tables.
  
- **Titration Calculator**: Calculate the pH at different points of a titration and determine the unknown molarity.

- **Solubility & Melting Point Predictors**: Reorder compounds based on solubility or melting point.

- **Practice Problems**: Over 100 practice problems covering various chemistry topics.

## Our Team

- **Chetan Gorantla** - Full-Stack Developer
